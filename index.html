        <div class="card-sub">A welcoming introduction to cybersecurity</div>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p>Welcome to INDY CTF, a beginner-friendly Capture The Flag competition hosted at Independence High School! This event is designed specifically for students who are curious about cybersecurity - no prior experience needed. Whether you've never coded before or you're already familiar with security concepts, there's a place for you here.</p>
            <p>We know that CTFs can seem intimidating, but it doesn't have to be! A CTF is essentially a puzzle-solving competition where you complete challenges to find hidden "flags" (special codes).  You'll learn by doing, with challenges designed to teach you as you go.</p>
            <p>Our mission is simple: create a safe environment where everyone, especially beginners,  can explore CTFs without fear. You'll be surprised what you can learn in just competition!</p>

        <div class="card-title">WHY PARTICIPATE?</div>
        <div class="card-sub">Everyone walks away with something valuable</div>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p><b>Learn Without Pressure</b></p>
            <p>This is a judgment-free zone. Stuck on a challenge? Ask for help. Never done this before? Perfect - that's who we designed this for! You'll learn practical skills in a supportive environment where mistakes are part of the learning process.</p>
            
            <p><b>Discover Hidden Talents</b></p>
            <p>You might not think you're "good at cybersecurity" - but how would you know if you've never tried? Many students surprise themselves by how much they enjoy and excel at challenges they thought would be too hard. This is your chance to discover abilities you didn't know you had.</p>
            
            <p><b>Build Real Skills</b></p>
            <p>Even if you only solve a few beginner challenges, you'll walk away having learned something tangible - whether it's basic encryption, how websites work, or how to think like a problem-solver. These skills are valuable for any tech career.</p>
            
            <p><b>Meet People Like You</b></p>
            <p>Connect with other students who are curious about technology and security. You'll find that most people are in the same boat - figuring things out, asking questions, and learning together. Some of your best friends might be sitting a few seats away!</p>
            
            <p><b>It's Actually Fun</b></p>
            <p>Solving a challenge feels like cracking a code in a spy movie. There's genuine excitement in that "aha!" moment when something clicks. Even if you don't finish every challenge, the ones you do solve will give you that rush of accomplishment.</p>
            
            <p><b>Low Risk, High Reward</b></p>
            <p>What's the worst that can happen? You learn something new. Best case? You discover a passion for cybersecurity and gain skills that could shape your future. There's literally no downside to trying!</p>

                <div class="faq-question">► I've never done anything like this before. Is that okay?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">That's MORE than okay - that's exactly who we want here! INDY CTF is specifically designed for beginners. You don't need any prior experience with cybersecurity, hacking, or even coding. We'll have intro challenges that teach you the basics, mentors to help you, and a friendly environment where questions are encouraged. Everyone starts somewhere, and this is a great place to start!</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">► What is a CTF?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">A Capture The Flag (CTF) competition is a cybersecurity event where participants solve security-related challenges to find hidden "flags" (special strings of text). It's like a digital scavenger hunt that tests your hacking skills, problem-solving abilities, and knowledge of security concepts. But don't worry - we start with the absolute basics!</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">► What if I'm not good at math or programming?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">You don't need to be! While some challenges involve problem-solving, many are more about creativity, research, and pattern recognition than math skills. Plus, there are different types of challenges - if programming isn't your thing, try forensics or OSINT challenges instead. And honestly, you might surprise yourself at what you can do when you try!</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">► What if I don't solve any challenges?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">First off, you will solve at least one - we promise! We have challenges designed specifically for absolute beginners. But even if you're struggling, just attempting challenges means you're learning. Ask mentors for help, work with teammates, use hints - that's all part of the process. There's no shame in finding things difficult; that's how learning works.</div>
